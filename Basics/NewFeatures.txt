* walrus operator (:=)
  Allows you to assign variables inside an expression. 
  The major benefit of this is to save you some lines of code and you can write even cleaner and compact code in Python

  num = [1,2,3,4,5]
  if( (size:=len(num1)) < 10 ):
    print(f”Length of list is small, size={size}”)

    Item = getItem()
    while Item:
        do_something(item)
        Item = getItem()
    
    can be replaced with

    while Item:= getItem():
        do_something(Item)

* Positional only arguments
