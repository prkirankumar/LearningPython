'''
* With Python closure, we donâ€™t need to use global values. This is because they let us refer to nonlocal variables. 
  A closure then provides some form of data hiding.
* When we have only a few Python methods (usually, only one), we may use a Python3 closure instead of implementing a class for that.
  This makes it easier on the programmer.
* A closure, lets us implement a Python decorator.
* A closure lets us invoke Python function outside its scope.
