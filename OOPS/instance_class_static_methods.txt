instance method (self): the object instance is implicitly passed as the first argument. 
This argument is called "self" and through this argument we have access to the instance of the class

class method (@classmethod) : instead of the self, the class of the object instance is implicitly passed as the first argument.
This argument is  called "cls" and through this argument we have access to class itself.
we can create alternative consturctor using the classmethod

static method (@staticmethod) : no argument is implicitly passed to the method. 
This methods should be logically related to the class.
