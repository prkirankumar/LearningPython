I was getting below error initially. Couldn't able to fix the issue on the same day. It took 2 days.

cx_Oracle.DatabaseError: DPI-1047: Cannot locate a 64-bit Oracle Client library

Analysis: 

I was having two Python 3.8 and Anaconda ( Python base 3.7 of conda). 

When ever i am installing 
pip install cx-Oracle, it was getting installed (pip from python 3.8). While interpreting the applicaiton I was getting below error.

Unable to import 'cx_Oracle' pylint (import-error)

The problem was with my VSCode IDE where it was mapped to conda's python.

Solution:

I need to install the cx-Oracle again using pip under C:\Anaconda3\Scripts
